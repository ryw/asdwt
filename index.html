                <h3>What You'll Learn</h3>
                <p>You'll learn how to add an AI Software Engineer to your team, that sits between non-technical and technical team members. This agent can handle the work that your engineers don't really like to do, but it can also take a first cut at any software engineering task. Adopting an AI teammate can double your team's product and software throughput.</p>
