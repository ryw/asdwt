                <h2>Connecting Tembo to Linear</h2>
                <p>Linear has become the project management tool of choice for many development teams due to its speed, simplicity, and developer-focused design. When integrated with Tembo, Linear transforms from a simple issue tracker into a powerful orchestration layer for AI-assisted development.</p>
                
                <p>The integration between Tembo and Linear creates a seamless workflow where product managers and team leads can define work in Linear, and Tembo can automatically understand context, estimate effort, and even begin implementationâ€”all while maintaining full visibility and control over the development process.</p>

                <h3>Setting Up the Integration</h3>
                <p>Connecting Tembo to your Linear workspace requires just a few configuration steps:</p>
                
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Linear API Token:</strong> Generate a personal API token from your Linear settings</li>
                    <li><strong>Workspace Configuration:</strong> Connect your Linear workspace to Tembo through the integrations panel</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Mapping:</strong> Map your Linear teams and projects to corresponding code repositories</li>
                    <li><strong>Workflow Preferences:</strong> Configure how Tembo should interpret Linear issue states and labels</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Understanding the Integration Architecture</h3>
                <p>Once connected, Tembo monitors your Linear workspace for specific triggers and patterns:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Issue Creation:</strong> New issues can automatically trigger Tembo analysis and effort estimation</li>
                    <li><strong>Status Changes:</strong> Moving issues to development states can queue them for AI implementation</li>
                    <li><strong>Label Triggers:</strong> Specific labels can indicate that an issue is ready for AI assistance</li>
                    <li><strong>Assignment Patterns:</strong> Assigning issues to Tembo (as a team member) initiates AI development</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>AI-Powered Task Management</h2>
                <p>With Tembo integrated into Linear, your task management becomes significantly more intelligent and efficient. The AI can understand issue context, break down complex requirements, and provide realistic estimates based on your codebase complexity.</p>

                <h3>Intelligent Issue Analysis</h3>
                <p>When Tembo analyzes a Linear issue, it performs several sophisticated operations:</p>
                
                <h4>Requirement Parsing</h4>
                <p>Tembo reads through issue descriptions and extracts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Core Requirements:</strong> What functionality needs to be implemented</li>
                    <li><strong>Acceptance Criteria:</strong> How success will be measured</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Constraints:</strong> Performance, security, or architectural requirements</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependencies:</strong> Other issues or external requirements that may impact development</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Codebase Context Assessment</h4>
                <p>Before providing estimates or beginning work, Tembo analyzes your existing codebase to understand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Similar features already implemented</li>
                    <li>Relevant code patterns and conventions</li>
                    <li>Potential areas of impact or integration</li>
                    <li>Available utility functions and components</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Effort Estimation and Planning</h3>
                <p>One of the most valuable aspects of AI-powered task management is getting realistic effort estimates early in the planning process.</p>
                
                <h4>AI-Generated Estimates</h4>
                <p>Tembo provides effort estimates by considering:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Implementation Complexity:</strong> Based on similar features in your codebase</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing Requirements:</strong> Unit, integration, and end-to-end test needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Documentation Impact:</strong> Updates needed for user guides and API documentation</li>
                    <li><strong>Integration Points:</strong> Number of systems or components that need modification</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Estimation Accuracy</h4>
                <p>Tembo's estimates improve over time as it learns from your team's patterns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Actual vs. estimated time tracking</li>
                    <li>Team velocity and capacity patterns</li>
                    <li>Codebase-specific complexity factors</li>
                    <li>Historical issue resolution data</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Automated Issue Tracking and Updates</h2>
                <p>Once development begins, Tembo automatically maintains synchronization between Linear and your development workflow, providing real-time visibility into progress without manual status updates.</p>

                <h3>Development Progress Tracking</h3>
                <p>As Tembo works on Linear issues, it automatically updates issue status and provides detailed progress information:</p>
