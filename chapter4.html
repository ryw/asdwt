                <h2>Connecting Tembo to Linear</h2>
                <p>Linear has become the project management tool of choice for many modern development teams due to its clean interface, powerful automation, and developer-focused workflows. When integrated with Tembo, Linear transforms from a simple task tracker into an intelligent project orchestration platform that bridges the gap between product planning and AI-assisted development.</p>
                
                <p>The Tembo-Linear integration enables seamless handoffs between human planning and AI execution, creating a workflow where product managers can define requirements in Linear, and Tembo automatically picks up these tasks for implementation.</p>

                <h3>Setting Up the Integration</h3>
                <p>Connecting Tembo to your Linear workspace requires API access and proper permission configuration. Here's how to establish this connection:</p>
                
                <h4>Linear API Setup</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate to your Linear settings and go to the "API" section</li>
                    <li>Generate a new API key with the following permissions:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Read access to issues, projects, and teams</li>
                            <li>Write access to issue updates and comments</li>
                            <li>Read access to user and team information</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Copy the generated API key for use in Tembo configuration</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h4>Tembo Configuration</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In your Tembo dashboard, navigate to "Integrations" → "Linear"</li>
                    <li>Paste your Linear API key in the configuration field</li>
                    <li>Select the Linear teams and projects you want Tembo to access</li>
                    <li>Configure notification preferences for issue updates and completions</li>
                    <li>Test the connection by syncing a sample issue</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Configuring Issue Templates</h3>

                <h2>AI-Powered Task Management</h2>
                <p>Once connected, Tembo can automatically process Linear issues, transforming high-level requirements into actionable development tasks. This AI-powered task management reduces the overhead of project coordination while maintaining visibility and control.</p>

                <h3>Automated Task Breakdown</h3>
                <p>When Tembo encounters a complex Linear issue, it can automatically break it down into smaller, manageable subtasks. This breakdown follows software engineering best practices and considers your codebase structure.</p>
                
                <h4>Example: E-commerce Checkout Feature</h4>
                <p>A Linear issue titled "Implement shopping cart checkout flow" might be automatically broken down by Tembo into:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Frontend Tasks:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create checkout form component with validation</li>
                            <li>Implement payment method selection interface</li>
                            <li>Add order review and confirmation screens</li>
                            <li>Handle loading states and error conditions</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Backend Tasks:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Create checkout API endpoints</li>
                            <li>Implement payment processing integration</li>
                            <li>Add order creation and inventory management</li>
                            <li>Set up email confirmation system</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                <p>The Linear integration transforms project management from a coordination overhead into a strategic advantage, enabling your team to focus on high-value work while AI handles the execution details. In the next chapter, we'll explore how error monitoring with Sentry creates another powerful feedback loop for AI-assisted development.</p>
