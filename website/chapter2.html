                <h2>Create Your First AI-Assisted Feature in GitHub</h2>
                <p>The best way to understand Tembo's power is by experiencing the complete value loop of AI-assisted software development: conceive → define → create → accept. This chapter will guide you through creating your first feature using Tembo's GitHub integration.</p>

                <h2>Step 1: Choose or Create a GitHub Repository</h2>
                <p>To get started with Tembo, you'll need a GitHub repository to work with. We recommend creating a new repository specifically for this tutorial to keep things clean and focused.</p>
                
                <h3>Creating a New Repository</h3>
                <p>Follow these steps to create a new GitHub repository:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Navigate to <a href="https://github.com/new" target="_blank">github.com/new</a></li>
                    <li>Choose any name you like for your repository (e.g., "my-first-tembo-project", "job-board-features", etc.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Important:</strong> Check the "Add a README file" option to initialize your repository</li>
                    <li>Leave the repository public for easier setup (you can change this later)</li>
                    <li>Click "Create repository"</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Your new repository will be created with a basic README.md file, providing the perfect starting point for your first AI-assisted feature.</p>

                <h2>Step 2: Sign Up for Tembo and Connect Your Repository</h2>
                <p>Now that you have a GitHub repository, it's time to connect it to Tembo and unlock AI-powered development capabilities.</p>
                
                <h3>Tembo Account Setup</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Visit <a href="https://tembo.io" target="_blank">tembo.io</a> and click "Sign Up"</li>
                    <li>Sign up using your GitHub account for seamless integration</li>
                    <li>Complete the onboarding process</li>
                    <li>When prompted, connect your newly created repository to Tembo</li>
                    <li>Grant the necessary permissions for Tembo to create branches and pull requests</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Once connected, Tembo will have access to your repository and can begin assisting with your development tasks.</p>

                <h2>Step 3: Your First AI-Assisted Feature</h2>
                <p>Now for the exciting part—let's use Tembo to create a meaningful feature that demonstrates the full AI-assisted development workflow.</p>
                
                <h3>Example Task: Job Board Feature List</h3>
                <p>We'll create a comprehensive feature list for a job board website, organized by priority. This is a perfect example of how AI can help with product planning and feature definition.</p>
                
                <h4>Creating the Task in Tembo</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Log into your Tembo dashboard</li>
                    <li>Navigate to your connected repository</li>
                    <li>Click "Create Task" to open the task creation window</li>
                    <li>Copy and paste this prompt into the task window:</li>
                </ol>
                
                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>Task Prompt:</strong><br>
                    "Generate a comprehensive feature list for a job board website, and add this list to the repository. Prioritize the features into 3 priority buckets: High Priority (must-have core features), Medium Priority (important but not critical), and Low Priority (nice-to-have enhancements). Include features for both job seekers and employers. Format the output as a well-structured markdown file that can serve as a product roadmap."</p>
                </blockquote>
                
                <h4>Understanding the AI Process</h4>
                <p>After submitting your task, Tembo will:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Conceive:</strong> Analyze your requirements and understand the scope</li>
                    <li><strong>Define:</strong> Break down the task into specific, actionable components</li>
                    <li><strong>Create:</strong> Generate the feature list and create a new file in your repository</li>
                    <li><strong>Present:</strong> Submit the work as a pull request for your review</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Step 4: Review the Pull Request</h2>
                <p>Once Tembo completes your task, you'll receive a pull request containing the generated feature list. This is where the collaborative aspect of AI-assisted development shines.</p>
                
                <h3>Reviewing AI-Generated Code</h3>
                <p>Navigate to your repository's "Pull Requests" tab to see Tembo's work. You'll find:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A detailed pull request description explaining what was created</li>
                    <li>The new markdown file with your job board feature list</li>
                    <li>Features organized into the three priority buckets you requested</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Requesting Changes</h3>
                <p>If you want to modify or expand the feature list, you can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Add comments directly to the pull request</li>
                    <li>Tag <code>@tembo</code> in your comments to request specific changes</li>
                    <li>Ask for additional features, different prioritization, or formatting changes</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>For example, you might comment: <em>"@tembo Please add mobile app features to the feature list and include user authentication requirements for each priority bucket."</em></p>

                <h2>Step 5: Merge the Pull Request</h2>
                <p>Once you're satisfied with the feature list, it's time to complete the development cycle by merging the pull request.</p>
                
                <h3>The Merge Process</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Review the final changes in the pull request</li>
                    <li>Click "Merge pull request" to accept the AI-generated work</li>
                    <li>Choose your preferred merge method (merge commit, squash and merge, or rebase and merge)</li>
                    <li>Add a merge commit message if desired</li>
                    <li>Click "Confirm merge"</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Completing the Value Loop</h3>
                <p>Congratulations! You've just completed your first full cycle of AI-assisted software development:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✅ <strong>Conceive:</strong> You identified the need for a job board feature list</li>
                    <li>✅ <strong>Define:</strong> You provided clear requirements and prioritization structure</li>
                    <li>✅ <strong>Create:</strong> Tembo generated comprehensive, well-organized content</li>
                    <li>✅ <strong>Accept:</strong> You reviewed, potentially refined, and merged the results</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What You've Accomplished</h2>
                <p>Through this hands-on exercise, you've experienced the core benefits of AI-assisted development:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Speed:</strong> Generated comprehensive features in minutes, not hours</li>
                    <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> AI considered aspects you might have initially overlooked</li>
